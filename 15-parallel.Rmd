# Parallel Computing {#parallel}

You would think that because you have an expensive multicore computer your computations will speed up. 
Well, no.
At least not if you don't make sure they do.
By default, no matter how many cores you have, the operating system will allocate each R session to a single core. 

For starters, we need to distinguish between two types of parallelism:

1. __Explicit parallelism__: where the user handles the parallelisation. 
1. __Implicit parallelism__: where the compiler handles the nonparallel.

Clearly, implicit parallelism is more desirable, but the state of mathematical computing is such that no sufficiently general implicit parallelism framework exists. 
The [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/awarded-projects) is currently financing a major project for a A "Unified Framework For Distributed Computing in R" so we can expect things to change soon. 
In the meanwhile, most of the parallel implementations are explicit. 



## Explicit Parallelism

R provides many frameworks for explicit parallelism.
Because the parallelism is initiated by the user, we first need to decide __when to parallelize?__
As a rule of thumb, you want to parallelise when you encounter a CPU bottleneck, and not a memory bottlenck.
Memory bottlenecks are released with Sparsity (Chapter \@ref(sparse)), or efficient representation (Chapter \@ref(memory)).

Several ways to diagnose your bottlenck include:

- Keep your Windows Task Manager, or Linux `top` open, and look for the CPU load. 
- The computation takes a long time, and when you stop it pressign ESC, R is immediatly responsive (if it is not immediatly responsive, you have a memory bottlenck).
