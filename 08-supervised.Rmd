# Supervised {#supervised}

Machine learning is very similar to statistics, but it is certainly not the same.
As the name suggests, in machine learning we want machines to learn.
This means that we want to replace hard-coded expoert algorithm, with data-driven self-learned algorithm.

There are many learning setups, that depend on what is available to the machine. 
The most common setup, discussed in this chapter, is _supervised learning_.
The name takes from the fact that by giving the machine data samples with known inputs (a.k.a. features) and desired outputs (a.k.a. labels), the human is effectively supervising the learning. 
If we think of the inputs as predictors, and outcomes as predicted, it is no wonder that supervised learning is very similar to statistical prediction.
When asked "are these the same?" I like to give the example of internet fraud.
If you take a sample of fraud "attacks", a statistical formulation of the problem is highly unlikely. 
This is because fraud events are not randomly drawn from some distribution, but rather, arrive from an adversary learning the defences and adapting to it. 
This instance of supervised learning belongs in game theory, more than it does in statistics. 

Other types of machine learning problems include:

- __Unsupervised learning__: See Chapter \@ref(unsupervised)
- __Semi supervised learning__: Where only part of the sample 
- __Reinforcement learning__:
- __Active learning__:
- __Structure learning__:
- __Structural learning__:
- __Transductive learning__:
- __Developpmental learning__:
- __Learning to learn__:
- __Manifold learning__:
- __Metric learning__:
- __Learning on a budget__:
