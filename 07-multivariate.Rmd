# Multivariate Data Analysis {#multivariate}

The term "multivariate data analysis" is so broad and so overloaded, that we start by clarifying what is discussed and what is not discussed in this chapter.
Broadly speaking, we will discuss statistical inference, and leave more "exploratory flavored" matters like clustering, and visualization, to the Unsupervised Learning Chapter \@ref(unsupervised).

More formally, let $y$ be a $p$ variate random vector, with $E[y]=\mu$.
We will discuss the problems of

- __Signal detection__: 
a.k.a. _multivariate hypothesis testing_, i.e., testing if $\mu$ equals $\mu_0$ and for $\mu_0=0$ in particular.
- __Signal counting__: 
Counting the number of elements in $\mu$ that differ from $\mu_0$, and for $\mu_0=0$ in particular.
- __Signal identification__:
a.k.a. _multiple testing_, i.e., testing which of the elements in $\mu$ differ from $\mu_0$ and for $\mu_0=0$ in particular. 
- __Signal estimation__: 
a.k.a. _selective inference_, i.e., estimating the magnitudes of the departure of $\mu$ from $\mu_0$, and for $\mu_0=0$ in particular. 
- __Multivariate Regression__:
a.k.a. _MANOVA_ in statistical literature, and _structured learning_ in the machine learning literature. 
- __Distribution fitting__:
A.k.a. _structure learning_  in the machine learning literature, deals with the fitting a distribution to samples from $y$. 
In particular, it deals with the identification of independencies between elements of $y$. 
For samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, learning the distribution implies all the above problem applied to $Var[y]$, instead of $E[y]$.
