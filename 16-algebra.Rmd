# Numerical Linear Algebra {#algebra}

In your algebra courses you would write $Ax=b$ and solve $x=A^_{-1}b$. 
This is useful to understand the algebraic properties of $x$, but a computer would never recover $x$ that way. 
Even the computation of the sample variance, $S^2(x)=(n-1)^{-1}\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2$ is not solved that way in a computer, because of numerical and speed considerations.

In this chapter, we dicuss several ways a computer solves systems of linear equations, with their application to statistics, namely, to OLS problems.  


## LU

## QR

## SVD
