# Generalized Linear Models {#glm}

```{example}
Consider the relation between cigarettes smoked, and the occurance of lung cancer. 
Do we expect it to be liner? Probably not.
Do we expect the variability to be constant about the trend, be it linear or not? Probably not.
```



## Problem Setup

In the Linear Models Chapter \@ref(linear), we assumed the generative process to be 
\begin{align}
  y|x=x'\beta+\varepsilon
  (\#eq:linear-mean-again)
\end{align}

This does not allow for assumingly non-linear relations, nor does it allow for the variablity of $\varepsilon$ to change with $x$.
Generalize linear models (GLM), as the name suggests, are a generalization that allow that.

```{remark}
Do not confuse _generalized linear models_ with _non-linear regression_, or _generalized least squares_.
These are different things, that we will not discuss.
```

To undestand GLM, we recall that with the normality of $\varepsilon$, Eq.\@ref(eq:linear-mean-again) implies that 
$$
 y|x \sim \mathcal{N}(x'\beta, \sigma^2)
$$
For the above example, we would like something in the lines of 
$$
 y|x \sim Binom(1,p(x))
$$
More generally, for some distribution $F(\theta)$, with a parameter $\theta$, we would like
\begin{align}
  y|x \sim F(\theta(x))
\end{align}

Possible examples include 
$$
 y|x \sim Poisson(\lambda(x)) \\
 y|x \sim Exp(\lambda(x)) \\
 y|x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu(x),\sigma^2(x)) 
$$
In this text, these distributions are the only ones we will discuss, even thought GLMS are slightly more general.
Also, constrain $\theta$ to be some function, $g$, of a linear combination of the $x$'s. 
Formally, $\theta(x)=g(x'\beta)$.
The function $g$ is called the _link_ function.
