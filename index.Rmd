# Preface

This book accompanies BGU's "R" course, at the department of Industrial Engineering and Management. 

It has several purposes:

-  Help me organize and document the course material.
- Help students during class so that they may focus on listening and not writing.
- Help students after class, so that they may self-study.


At its current state it is experimental. 
It can thus be expected to change from time to time, and include mistakes.
I will be enormously grateful to whoever decides to share with me any mistakes found.

I am enourmously grateful to Yihui Xie, who's *bookdown* R package made it possibly to easily write a book which has many mathematical formulae, and R output. 

I hope the reader will find this text interesting and useful.
