# The Hadleyverse {#hadley}

The _Hadleyverse_, short for "Hadley Wickham's universe", is a set of packages that make it easier to handle data. 
If you are developping packages, you should be careful as using these packages may create many dependencies and compatibility issues. 
If you are analyzing data, and the postability of your script to other users, machines, and operating systems is not of a concern, you will LOVE these packages. 
The term Hadleyverse refers to __all__ of Hadley's packages, but here, we mention only a useful subset, which can be collectively installed via the __tidyverse__ package:

- __ggplot2__ for data visualisation. See the Plotting Chapter \@ref(plotting).
- __dplyr__ for data manipulation.
- __tidyr__ for data tidying.
- __readr__ for data import.
